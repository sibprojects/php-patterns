Explanation:
<ol>
    <li>AuthenticateStage: This stage checks if the user is authenticated.</li>
    <li>ValidateDataStage: This stage ensures that the data provided is valid.</li>
    <li>BusinessLogicStage: This step processes the main business logic.</li>
    <li>ResponseStage: Finally, the result is generated and returned as a response.</li>
</ol>

Each stage implements the PipelineStage interface, ensuring that the process method is consistently applied across all stages. This modular design makes it easy to modify or add additional stages without affecting the overall pipeline.
